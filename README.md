Welcome to El-Corona

*Make sure to copy the whole folder as there are images files attached 
*The game can be run from Data class
*Every human has a unique ID which ranges from 1 and up to the size of population. The final Human ID will be same as the number of population

1. Input the number of household required when prompted( A household can contain 1- 5 person).
2. If the number of household more than thousand, it would take some time create the log file for all the population before the simulation is started.
3. The dots represent the humans and when they are infected, the dot turns red and then cured when cured(after 15 days of infected)
   The simulation can be controlled with the start/pause button, +/- button to adjust the speed of simulation, and the skip button to skip to next day.
4. Lagging will occur when the day finishes or when you skip the day as the system may take time creating the log files depending
   on the population.
5. The user can manually input the human using the infect button and the human ID of the infected people will be shown in the side panel.
6.  The contact tracer button asks user input of the humanID, start day of reading the log files and the end day and the depth if 
the tree you wish to create.
7. The contact tracer can be used for any person whether they are infected or not. The contact tracer shows the tree, personal 
information of the person and the daily activity log of the person for the input days.
